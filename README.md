# Apple Frameworks Showcase

This is a simple iOS app built with SwiftUI that showcases various Apple frameworks. It provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface to explore and learn about different frameworks offered by Apple.

## Features

- Grid and List Views: The app utilizes SwiftUI's flexible grid and list views to present the frameworks in a visually pleasing and structured manner. Users can switch between grid and list layouts based on their preference.

- MVVM Architecture: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, promoting separation of concerns and code reusability. The model represents the data and business logic, the view handles the UI rendering, and the view model acts as a mediator between the model and view, handling presentation and user interactions.

- Dynamic Content: The app dynamically fetches and displays the available Apple frameworks, ensuring that the content is always up to date. It leverages data-driven SwiftUI features to update the UI based on changes in the underlying data model.

- Framework Details: Users can tap on a framework to view its details, including a brief description and a button to learn more about the framework. Tapping the button opens a Safari view with additional information about the selected framework.
